## Common Grammar Issues

Dangling Modifiers. Modifiers that don't clearly or logically modify anything in the sentence. Incorrect: Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful. Correct: Walking down the street, I saw beautiful trees.

Comma Splices. Using a comma to join two independent clauses without a conjunction. Incorrect: She is nice, she is friendly. Correct: She is nice, and she is friendly.

Run-on Sentences. Two or more independent clauses joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions. Incorrect: She went to the store she bought milk. Correct: She went to the store, and she bought milk.

Fragment Sentences. Incomplete sentences missing a subject, verb, or complete thought. Incorrect: Because it was raining. Correct: Because it was raining, I stayed home.

Double Negatives. Using two negative words in the same clause, which often creates a positive meaning in Standard English. Incorrect: I don't have no money. Correct: I don't have any money.

Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement. Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number, gender, and person. Incorrect: Each student should bring their book. (Traditional rule) Correct: Each student should bring his or her book. (Modern usage often accepts "their" as gender-neutral singular.)

Misplaced Modifiers. Modifiers that are not placed close to the words they modify. Incorrect: She almost drove the car for two hours. Correct: She drove the car for almost two hours.

Subject-Verb Agreement. Subjects and verbs must agree in number. Incorrect: The group of students are studying. Correct: The group of students is studying.

## Advanced Grammar Concepts

Active Voice vs. Passive Voice. In active voice, the subject performs the action. In passive voice, the subject receives the action. Active: The cat chased the mouse. Passive: The mouse was chased by the cat.

Participles. Verb forms that can function as adjectives. Present participles end in -ing, past participles typically end in -ed. Examples: the running water, the broken glass.

Gerunds. -ing forms of verbs that function as nouns. Example: Swimming is good exercise.

Infinitives. The base form of a verb, often preceded by "to." Example: to run, to jump, to be.

Modal Verbs. Auxiliary verbs that express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability. Examples: can, could, should, would, must, might.

Subjunctive Mood. Used for hypothetical situations, wishes, and in certain expressions. Example: If I were rich, I would travel the world.

Conditional Sentences. Express hypothetical situations and their consequences. Examples: If it rains, we will stay home. If it rained, we would stay home. If it had rained, we would have stayed home.

Relative Clauses. Clauses that modify nouns, introduced by relative pronouns. Examples: The book that I read was interesting. The man, who lives next door, is a doctor.
