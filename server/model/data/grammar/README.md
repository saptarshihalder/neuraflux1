# Grammar Training for NeuraFlux

This directory contains resources and scripts for training the NeuraFlux model specifically on English grammar datasets. The goal is to enhance the model's ability to understand and generate grammatically correct English text.

## Dataset Structure

The grammar dataset consists of the following files:

1. **english_grammar.txt**: Basic English grammar rules and definitions with examples.
2. **english_sentences.txt**: A collection of well-formed English sentences demonstrating various grammatical structures.
3. **grammar_corrections.txt**: Pairs of incorrect sentences and their grammatically correct versions.
4. **advanced_grammar.txt**: Advanced grammatical structures and their explanations.
5. **combined_grammar_dataset.txt**: The combined dataset used for training (generated by the script).

## Scripts

- **combine_grammar_datasets.py**: Script to combine all grammar datasets into a single file for training.
- **train_grammar.py**: Script to train the NeuraFlux model on the combined grammar dataset.
- **evaluate_grammar.py**: Script to evaluate the model's grammar capabilities after training.

## Training Process

Follow these steps to train the model on the grammar dataset:

1. **Prepare the data**: Make sure all the grammar dataset files are in place. The scripts will generate the combined dataset automatically.

2. **Train the model**: Run the training script with appropriate parameters:

   ```bash
   python train_grammar.py --output_dir grammar_model --num_epochs 5 --batch_size 16
   ```

   This will:
   - Combine all grammar datasets into a single file
   - Train the model using the combined dataset
   - Save the trained model to the specified output directory

3. **Evaluate the model**: After training, evaluate the model's performance on grammar correction tasks:

   ```bash
   python evaluate_grammar.py --model_dir grammar_model --output_file evaluation_results.json
   ```

   This will generate a report on how well the model can correct grammatical errors.

## Customization

You can customize the training process by modifying the following:

- **Dataset files**: Add more examples to the existing dataset files or create new ones.
- **Training parameters**: Adjust learning rate, epochs, batch size, model size, etc.
- **Evaluation criteria**: Modify the evaluation script to focus on specific grammar aspects.

## Model Performance

The model's performance on grammar tasks depends on several factors:

- **Dataset quality**: The diversity and quality of grammar examples
- **Training duration**: Number of epochs and steps
- **Model size**: Number of layers, attention heads, and hidden dimensions
- **Knowledge transfer**: Utilization of teacher models during training

## Integration with NeuraFlux

The grammar-enhanced model can be integrated with the main NeuraFlux system by:

1. Using it as a specialized model for grammar-related tasks
2. Fine-tuning the main model with grammar-specific knowledge
3. Implementing a grammar checking service based on the trained model

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include:

- Expanding the grammar dataset with more examples
- Adding support for different languages
- Implementing more sophisticated evaluation metrics
- Creating a grammar correction service API
