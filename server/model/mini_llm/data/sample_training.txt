Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing.
Small language models (SLMs) are more efficient alternatives to large language models.
Knowledge distillation allows smaller models to learn from larger teacher models.
The Byte Pair Encoding algorithm is used for subword tokenization.
Transformer models use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences.
Gated Linear Units improve the parameter efficiency of transformer models.
Rotary Position Embeddings provide better position encoding for transformers.
Teacher-student knowledge transfer helps in training smaller, more efficient models.
Sliding window attention reduces the computational complexity of transformers.
Character-level tokenization has high vocabulary overhead for uncommon languages.
WordPiece tokenization is similar to BPE but uses a different frequency-based approach.
Self-supervised learning enables models to learn without explicit labels.
Layer normalization helps stabilize the training of deep neural networks.
Multi-head attention allows models to attend to information from different perspectives.
The feed-forward network in transformers processes each position independently.
Residual connections help in training very deep neural networks.
Dropout is a regularization technique that prevents overfitting.
Gradient accumulation allows training with effectively larger batch sizes.
Mixed-precision training speeds up training while reducing memory usage.
Knowledge transfer can combine strengths of multiple teacher models.
BPE merges frequent character pairs to form new tokens.
Attention masks prevent the model from attending to padding tokens.
Hidden state matching aligns the internal representations of student and teacher models.
Contrastive learning helps the model distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples.
